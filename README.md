# Final-Project
My Quarantine Super Fun Bundle
Welcome to my final project. So when thinking of a final, I was stumped. 
I couldn't think of anything until my brother looked at me and started speaking in pig Latin.
We happened to be playing tic tac toe at the time because of quarantine, and there not much else to do. 
I have never been able to understand Pig Latin, so I thought about creating a code to translate it just like we had done with the cipher project. 
So I thought of creating some fun codes that people can do while bored in quarantine. 
I made a two-player tic tac toe, which I know is not super unique, but It was fun to struggle while trying to make something that I had never done before.
Along with a way to learn a secret language, aka Pig Latin. Here is the quarantine bundle of tic tac toe and Pig Latin.

Learn a new language while playing a childhood game.
Who would have thought these two things would ever go together.
Just fun little quarantine activities.

### Pig Latin 

```
"""
Two options for quarantine boredem.
You can play tic tac toe or forgot english and only speak in Pig Latin.

I remeber when I was a kid I could never figure out how to speak pig latin.
So I thought why not create a code to translate it for me.
However I didnt know if this was enough for my final so I just thought I would add it
in for fun. 
Something fun to learn during quarantine.

### Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to two player tic tac toe. Something fun to play and do during quarentine. 
You can ether play tic tac toe which family or get a laugh from the Pig Latin translator.

### Thank You 
Thank You for a great semester. Also upload direct flies of my code from my mimir because at first I could not get github to upload my code properly and it was confusing to firgure out. But I got it to work in the end I think. 
Thank you and stay health and safe during these hard times. 

ALSO I NEVER KNEW TRYING TO MAKE A FOLDER ON GITHUB WOULD BE SO HARD TO FIRGURE OUT BUT THEN BE SOME SO SIMPLE. 

Anyways have a get summer.
